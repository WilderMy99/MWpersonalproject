            <p>I made this blog in HTML following traversysmedia on youtube. It took roughly two hours to learn the basics and create my own page. I now have made a page to show my website, a page to show my portolio and a page to show my blog posts

            <p>I'm starting to understand the little that I know about coding. Pretty much on a simple website I can tell you what each tag and attribute I used means. That is a step in the right direction for me on this journey.
